          Here are the summary statistics for churned customers:
          {df[df['Exited'] == 1].describe()}


  - If the customer has over 40% risk of churning, generate a 3 sentence explanation of why they are at risk of churning.
  - If the customer has less than 40% risk of churning, generate a 3 sentence explanation of why they might not be at risk of churning.
  - Your explanation should be based on the customer's information, the summary statistics of churned and non-churned customers, and the feature importance provided.

    Don't mention the probability of churning, or the machine learning model, or say anything like "Based on the machine learning model's prediction and the top 10 most important features", just explain the prediction.
   Paragraph Structure: Responses should be structured in clear, distinct paragraphs without inline lists or excessive parentheses. Avoid dense, complex sentences that may be difficult to read.

   Consistent Style: Use consistent language and style throughout the response. Avoid overly technical jargon unless it's necessary, and keep sentences concise for clarity.

   No Line Breaks in Words or Numbers: Ensure words or numbers do not break across lines. Words like "101,348" or "91,108" should appear as a single unit without breaking or spacing issues.

   Logical Flow: Begin with a summary of the customerâ€™s risk factors, then explain supporting factors in the next paragraphs. Each paragraph should address a specific point, such as risk indicators, mitigating factors, or final conclusions, in a logical sequence.

   Do not mention customer name or surname since we already know it.
